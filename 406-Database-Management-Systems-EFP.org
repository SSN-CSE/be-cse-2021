** STUDIO SESSIONS (15 sessions of 3 hours each)
/Sample Case Study/: Online booking and service system

/Variants/
   - Online car rental booking system (ola)
   - Online food / medicine / courier / groceries delivery system (swiggy)
   - Online healthcare/ legal services / homeneeds (carpentry / plumbing etc)

1. The students are first taught the fundamentals of conceptual
   modeling of a given application and relational database design. The
   instructor provides the necessary reading materials such as links
   on google, industry links and professional magazine articles
   available in SSN library and asks the students to study different
   database systems and industrial applications based on the
   fundamentals learnt.
   
   The students must submit a short report on various problems and
   applications, tools and knowledge required to design such a system
   summarizing their observations and limitations.
2. The instructor introduces the general aspects of Online booking and
   service system with constraints involved. Further, the faculty
   provides pointers to several variants of this system mentioned
   above.
3. The Students are grouped in teams and each team is asked to
   formulate a variant of Online booking and service system and
   identify the constraints and scope of their problem.
4. The students are asked to study the pros and cons of top-down and
   bottom-up approaches and choose the suitable one with proper
   justification.
5. The students must evolve a conceptual model of the formulated
   problem capturing all the constraints and scenarios involved. They
   should observe the limitation of the ER model not that does not
   capture a particular constraint and find out ways to still include
   it in the design.
6. The students need to decide the type of database model ( RM, ORDB,
   NoSQL -- columnar/graph/document/key-value / XML) to suit the
   application requirements and justify it.
7. The students will come up with the database schema design by
   applying the fundamentals of normalization with a focus on data
   integrity, consistency, and security (access control / role based)
   requirements.
8. The students will then design a suitable front-end application with
   a suitable technology (web based or mobile application or
   standalone or distributed)
9. The students are asked to explore safety, health, ethical,
   environmental, societal impact (whichever applicable) of the
   applications and investigate legal and ethical aspects. A detailed
   report of the problem formulation, scope and constraints, front end
   and back-end design must be submitted.
10. The students will create the databases and implement the
    application. The system must be validated against the formulated
    requirements in different scenarios and constraints.
11. The students are asked to demonstrate their solutions in two
    stages (after 50% completion and after 100% completion of the
    implementation)
12. The students will be asked to test their solution under different
    data loads. Wherever applicable, the students will perform load
    testing and
13. The students are asked to present their problem,
    methodology/approach, database design and solution.
14. The students are asked to document a learning experience as a
    reflection of their skills acquired.
15. Students are asked to explore the advantages and/or
    limitations of their solution in terms of performance,
    security, user experience, reusability and extendibility.


\hfill *Total Hours: 30 + 15 + 45 = 90*

** COURSE OUTCOMES
After the completion of this course, students will be able to:
 1. Formulate problem, understanding the requirements and
    derive its conceptual model showing the constraints.
 2. Apply database fundamentals to advanced industrial
    applications or products.
 3. Design and develop solutions using top-down or bottom-up
    approach and using contemporary storage models
 4. Communicate effectively through reflections, reports, and
    presentations.
 5. Work in teams to develop modules and integrate them.
 6. Analyze the impact on health, safety, society, environment
    as well as underlying legal and ethical considerations
    wherever are applicable.
