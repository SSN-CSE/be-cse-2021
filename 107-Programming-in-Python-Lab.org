** COURSE OBJECTIVES
   - To write, test, and debug simple Python programs.
   - To apply conditions and loops to solve problems using python.
   - To implement programs using functions
   - To write programs using different data types such as strings, lists tuples and dictionaries
   - To make use of read and write operations into the files.
   

** SUGGESTIVE EXERCISES
   1. Use Linux shell commands, use Python in interactive mode, and an
      editor
   2. Write simple programs (area of a geometric shape, simple
      interest, solve quadratic equation, net salary).
   3. Write programs using conditional statements (leap year, maximum
      of 2 numbers, maximum of 3 numbers, simple calculator, grade of
      the total mark).
   4. Develop programs using loops and nested loops (gcd, prime
      number, integer division, sum of digits of an integer,
      multiplication table, sum of a series, print patterns, square
      root using Newton's method).
   5. Develop programs using functions (sine and cosine series,
      Pythagorean triplets).
   6. Develop programs using recursion (efficient power of a number,
      factorial, Fibonacci number).
   7. Develop programs using strings (palindrome, finding substring)
      without using in-built functions.
   8. Develop programs using lists and tuples (linear search, binary
      search, selection sort, insertion sort, quicksort).
   9. Develop programs using nested lists (matrix manipulations).
   10. Develop simple programs using dictionaries (frequency
       histogram, nested dictionary).
   11. Develop programs using Files (read and write files).
   12. Develop programs to perform any task by reading arguments from
       command line.
   13. Implement a simple application using appropriate datatypes and
       files

** COURSE OUTCOMES
After the completion of this course, students will be able to
1. Develop and debug simple Python programs (K3)
2. Build Python programs with conditionals and loops (K3)
3. Solve a problem using functions in python programming (K3)
4. Construct python programs using compound data like lists, tuples,
   and dictionaries (K3)
5. Build a simple application in teams using files and appropriate
   datatypes by applying the best programming practices (K3).
