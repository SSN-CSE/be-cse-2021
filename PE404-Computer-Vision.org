#+begin_comment
- 1. Almost the same as EC8093  DIGITAL IMAGE PROCESSING in AU 2017
- 2. Change in Unit V (see the comment below unit V)
- 3. Unit - II in PCP1279(M.E. CSE Image Processing and Analysis)is
     split into Unit- II and III
     Image segmentation and Feature analysis methods in Unit- III of PCP1279 are moved to Unit - IV and 
     Unit - V respectively.
     The topic object recognition is added in Unit - V
- 4. Five Course outcomes specified and aligned with units
- 5. Not Applicable.
