** R2021 CHANGES :noexport:
1. Added case study in units 2,4 & 5
2. Modified CO5 from K3 to K4
3. CO6 is added to map the soft POs and mapping done accordingly.
4. Almost the same as EC8093  DIGITAL IMAGE PROCESSING in AU 2017
5. Change in Unit V (see the comment below unit V)
6. Unit - II in PCP1279(M.E. CSE Image Processing and Analysis)is
   split into Unit- II and III
   Image segmentation and Feature analysis methods in Unit- III of PCP1279 are moved to Unit - IV and 
   Unit - V respectively.
   The topic object recognition is added in Unit - V
7. Five Course outcomes specified and aligned with units


** COURSE OBJECTIVES

- To understand the basics of simple image enhancement techniques in
  Spatial and Frequency domain
- To learn the concepts of degradation function and restoration
  techniques
