1. This syllabus was not offered under AU-2017 Regulations for UG.
2. Introduces the Deep learning theory to undergraduate students which is recent trend and 
   has its application in different areas.
3. This subject is offered under M.E syllabus with additional unit on Deep learning with Tensorflow. 
   For changes, see the individual units.
4. Five Course outcomes specified and aligned with units.
5. No lab.
