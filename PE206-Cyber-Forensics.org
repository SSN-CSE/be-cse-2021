1. Almost the same as AU
2. The changes are listed below.
   - Unit-1: AU-Unit I included.
   - Unit-2: AU-Unit I topics included
     AU-Unit I data acquisition topics is elaborated
   - Unit-3: AU-Unit II topics included
     AU-Unit III topics included
   - Unit-4: AU-Unit III topics included
   - Unit-5: New tools topics included
     Ehtical hacking given in AU-Unit IV in SNU syllabus and V is not included in SNU.
3. Not Applicable
4. Five Course outcomes specified and aligned with units
5. Not Applicable
6. Did not include Kali Linux or Metasploit tools, as they are
   penetration testing tools to detect the vulnerabilities.
