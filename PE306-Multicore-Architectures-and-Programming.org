** R2021 CHANGES :noexport:
1. Same as R2018
2. COs and COs mapping are changed

#+begin_comment
- 1. Almost the same as AU
- 2. No changes 
- 3. Few topics of First unit in PG subject "Multicore Architectures
  and GPU Computing" are matching which is essential for understanding
  the basics. The rest of the four units are different.  With respect
  to the PG Elective paper "Parallel Programming", the following
  observations are noticed:
  + Few topics in Unit 1 of both the subjects are matched.
  + Third unit of PE305-MULTICORE ARCHITECTURE AND PROGRAMMING is
    same as fourth unit of PE231-Parallel Programming of PG syllabus.
  + Fourth unit of PE305-MULTICORE ARCHITECTURE AND PROGRAMMING
    is same as second unit of PE231-Parallel Programming of PG
    syllabus.
- 4. Five Course outcomes specified and aligned with units
- 5. Not Applicable

** COURSE OUTCOMES
After the completion of this course, students will be able to 
1. Summarize the limitations of single core processors and the concepts behind the
   various multi-core architectures (K2)
2. Infer the issues in programming Parallel Processors (K2)
3. Develop the programs using OpenMP (K3) 
4. Develop the program using  MPI (K3)
5. Compare and contrast programming for serial processors and
   programming for parallel processors (K2)
6. Solve real world problems in teams by choosing parallel programming
   and applying best practices in programming with a clear
   documentation of algorithm and approach (K3).
