** R2018 CHANGES :noexport:
1. Unit IV of CS8491 COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE in Anna University R2017 is
   moved here as Unit V with the change:
2. Removed: Clusters; Warehouse Scale Computers and other
   Message-Passing Multiprocessors.

** R2021 CHANGES :noexport:
1. Subword parallelism dropped from Unit 2
2. Cache mapping techniques added in Unit 5
3. Almost the same as AU
4. For changes, see the comments below the units, Unit IV and Unit V
5. Five Course outcomes specified and aligned with units
6. Included problems introduced by predictive branching: Spectre and Meltdown.
7. Since the text books are not available, website links are provided in References.

** COURSE OBJECTIVES
- To learn the basic structure and operations of a computer 
- To learn the arithmetic and logic unit and implementation of
  fixed-point and floating point arithmetic unit
- To learn the basics of pipelined execution
