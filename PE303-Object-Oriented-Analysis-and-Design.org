** R2021 CHANGES :noexport:
1. No change in units from R-2018
2. The Course ourcomes are rephrased and aligned with the units. And CO-PO-PSO Mappings are done as per the expert's suggestions.

#+begin_comment
1. Sixth Course outcome specified and aligned with units
2. No change of content from R-2018
3. Reference book edition is changed for "Design patterns: Elements of Reusable Object Oriented Software", Pearson Education, 2015.

** COURSE OBJECTIVES
- To understand and differentiate Unified Process from other approaches 
- To understand object-oriented software design using UML's static diagrams
- To understand software modeling using the UML's dynamic diagrams
- To learn improving software design with design patterns
- To learn testing the software with its requirements specification.

** COURSE OUTCOMES
Upon completion of this course, the students should be able to
1. Summarize software design with UML diagrams (K2)
2. Inspect and implement projects using OO concepts (K4)
3. Identify and map basic software requirements in UML mapping (K3)
4. Analyze UML based software design into pattern based design using
   design patterns (K4)
5. Test for any object-oriented software against its requirements
   (K4)
6. Assess a system in teams and apply best practices and principles in
   software design patterns with a clear documentation of the UML
   diagrams and approach (K5).
