** R2021 CHANGES :noexport:
1. Almost the same as AU
2. For changes, see the individual units.
3. Five Course outcomes specified 
4. Suggestive experiments given
5. Justifications for comments given by Mr. R.Pradeep - 
   1. All the topics available in the IIT Kharagpur are included in
      the Syllabus
   2. Apart from the topics in IIT Karagpur, we have included Routing
      algorithms as well.

** COURSE OBJECTIVES
- To learn and use network commands.
- To learn socket programming.
- To implement and analyze various network protocols.
- To learn and use simulation tools.
- To use simulation tools to analyze the performance of various network protocols.

** SUGGESTIVE EXPERIMENTS
1. Learn to use commands like tcpdump, netstat, ifconfig, nslookup and traceroute. Capture ping and traceroute PDUs using a network protocol analyzer and examine. 
2. Write applications using TCP sockets like:
   - Echo client and echo server
   - Chat
   - File Transfer
3. Simulate of DNS using UDP sockets.
4. Write Programs to implement flow control protocol in data link layer.
5. Simulation of error detection code (like CRC).
6. Write programs simulating ARP /RARP protocols.
7. Study of Network simulator (NS) and Simulate a wired topology using NS.
8. Simulate Distance Vector/ Link State Routing algorithm.
9. Study of TCP/UDP performance using Simulation tool.
10. Simulation of Congestion Control Algorithms using NS2 and analyse its performance.


\hfill *Total Periods: 45*
