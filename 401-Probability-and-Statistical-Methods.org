** COURSE OBJECTIVES
- To identify the standard distributions and apply them in solving
  problems.
- To solve problems in joint probabilities and to find correlation
  between them.
- To perform hypothesis testing using normal, t, F, chi square
  distribution
- To evaluate the tests of significance in analysis of variance.
- To calculate the various statistical quality control measurements.
