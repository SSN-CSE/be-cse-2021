2018
1. This course syllabus is substantially different from the current one in Anna University curriculum in unit IV and V.
2. Unit IV, Uncertainty is given instaed of Software agents.Unit V, Introduction to Learning is given, instead of Applications.
3. Not Applicable
4. Five Course outcomes specified and aligned with units
5. Lab Exercises are given for each unit.

1. Unit V - COMMUNICATIONG. PERCEIVING AND ACTING, is given instaed of Learning, since Machine Learning comes in the same semester.
2. Five Course outcomes specified and aligned with units
3. Lab Exercises are given for each unit.
4. CO6 is included.
5. CO-PO-PSO mapping is updated
