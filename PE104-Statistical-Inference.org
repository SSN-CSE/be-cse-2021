** COURSE OBJECTIVES
- To identify the standard distributions and apply them in solving problems
- To understand the concept of two-dimensional random variables and solve
  problems in finding the Joint probabilities and correlation between
  them
- To perform hypothesis testing using normal, t-distribution and F-distribution
- To evaluate the tests of significance in analysis of variance
- To calculate the various statistical quality control measurements.

** COURSE OUTCOMES
After the completion of this course, students will be able to: 
- Identify standard distributions and apply them
- Solve problems in two dimension random variables and find the
  correlation between them
- Identify and apply the suitable testing of hypothesis under normal
  and t and F distribution
- Solve problems in analysis of variance
- Analyze quality control by applying control chart methods.
