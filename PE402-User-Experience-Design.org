** R2021 CHANGES :noexport:
1. No change in units from R-2018
2. The Course ourcomes are rephrased and aligned with the units. And CO-PO-PSO Mappings are done as per the expert's suggestions.
3. Brian Fling added as Text Book to align with the units. Bill Scot and Theresa Neil moved to references.
4. Text Books contents are verified to align with the units and are marked in the syllbus.

** COURSE OUTCOMES
Upon the completion of the course the students should be able to: 
- Summarize the goals and principles of interface design (K2)
- Apply life cycle models and identify the requirements for interface
  design (K3)
- Construct user interface design using prototypes (K3)
- Develop user testing on user interface design (K3)
- Apply tools to develop UI design for mobile app (K3).
- Solve real world problems in teams by choosing suitable software problem and  applying best practices in programming  with a clear documentation  of problem statement and design interfaces. (K3)
