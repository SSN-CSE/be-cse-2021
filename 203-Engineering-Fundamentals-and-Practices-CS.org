** Lab Assignments in C (15 hours)
1.	Algorithm writing, verification and test case design (1)
2.	Programs using looping constructs (for, while, do-while)
3.	Programs using functions with different parameter passing techniques: Call by value (e.g. swapping two numbers), call by reference (e.g. changing the elements of an array), Recursion (e.g. binary search)
4.	Programs using one dimensional arrays (e.g. inserting an element after every ith position in an array, Insertion sort)
5.	Programs using strings and their operations (e.g. concatenation of strings, extracting a substring, checking for palindrome, search for a given string using binary search)
6.	Programs to demonstrate simple structure manipulations and passing structures to a function (e.g. generating a transcript with CGPA and class obtained, operations on complex numbers, difference between times)

In all the above assignments, wherever applicable, focus on reflection and introspection on learning outcome. 

** STUDIO SESSIONS (45 hours)
- /Sample Case Study/: Timetable Management System for an Academic
  Institution
- /Input/: Set of courses in a semester, Type of courses, Classrooms,
  Labs, Faculty offerings, Student degree, Year and Section
- /Output/: Timetable for a week satisfying the following constraints
- /Constraints/:
  - All theory courses for a class are scheduled in the same room.
  - More than one lab course cannot be scheduled in the lab at the same time.
  - A faculty does not handle more than 2 sessions per day for the same course.
  - A faculty cannot handle more than one class in each session.

\hfill *Total Hours: 30 + 60 = 90*

** COURSE OUTCOMES
After the completion of this course, students will be able to:
1. Formulate a problem, specifying the requirements and
   identifying the scope and boundaries.
2. Apply engineering fundamentals in Computer Science to
   industrial applications or products.
3. Design and develop solutions with novel technologies,
   tools, and techniques.
4. Communicate effectively through reflections, reports, and
   presentations.
5. Work in teams to develop modules and integrate them.
6. Analyze the impact on health, safety, society, environment
   as well as underlying legal and ethical considerations
   wherever are applicable.
7. Solve programming problems using basic constructs in C programming language.

** INSTRUCTIONS
1. Instructor provides the links in Internet, industry links
   and professional magazine articles available in SSN
   library and asks the students to study systems or
   industrial applications based on the fundamentals learnt.
   Students must submit a short report on various problems
   and applications, tools and knowledge required to design
   such a system.
2. The instructor introduces the general aspects of timetable management / scheduling problem and constraints involved. Further, the faculty provides pointers to applications of this problem in various other domains.
3. Students are grouped into teams and each team is asked to
   formulate timetable management in different domains and
   identify the scope and constraints of their problem.
4. Students are asked to evolve an architecture design along
   with the design of individual modules. They need to plan a
   timeline too.
5. Students are asked to explore safety, health, ethical,
   environmental, societal impact (whichever applicable) of
   the applications and investigate legal and ethical
   aspects. A detailed report of the problem formulation,
   scope and constraints, design must be submitted.
6. Students are asked to find out the technologies used to
   implement their work and analyze the feasibility. With the
   selected tools and technologies, they are asked to
   implement their solution.
7. Students are asked to demonstrate their solutions in two
   stages (after 50% completion and after 100% completion of
   the implementation)
8. Students are asked to present their problem, methodology,
   and solution.
9. Students are asked to document their learning experience
   as a reflection of the skills acquired.
10. Students are asked to explore limitations of their
    solution in terms of security, reliability, code
    reusability and adaptability.

** EVALUATION
EFP will be assessed by a committee of faculty members based
on Studio Sessions, Reflections, Presentation and
Documentation. *EFP will be evaluated based on continuous
assessment only.*
