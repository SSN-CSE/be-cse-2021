** COURSE OBJECTIVES
- To provide exposure to the students with hands on experience on
  various basic engineering practices in Civil, Mechanical, Electrical
  and Electronics Engineering

** LIST OF EXPERIMENTS

** GROUP A (CIVIL & MECHANICAL) 

*I CIVIL ENGINEERING PRACTICE*
    
*Buildings*:
1. Study of plumbing and carpentry components of residential and
   industrial buildings - Safety aspects.

*Plumbing Works*:
1. Study of pipeline joints, its location and functions: valves, taps,
   couplings, unions, reducers, and elbows in household fittings.
2. Preparation of plumbing line sketches for water supply and sewage
   works.
3. Hands-on-exercise: 
   - Basic pipe connections - Mixed pipe material connection - Pipe
     connections with different joining components.
   - Plumbing with basic connections for washing basin and sink

*Carpentry using Power Tools only*:
1. Study of the joints in roofs, doors, windows and furniture.
2. Hands-on-exercise: Wood work, joints by sawing, planning and
   cutting.
   - Fabrication of different models of pencil box and pen stand.
   - Fabrication of wooden wall shelf
3. Demonstration of wood working machinery

    
*II MECHANICAL ENGINEERING PRACTICE*

*Basic Machining*:
1. Drilling Practice (holes of various diameters - steel sheet metal,
   wood, hylam/plywood sheet)

*Sheet Metal Work*:
1. Forming & Bending
2. Different type of joints.
   - Fabrication of mobile phone metal stand
   - Fabrication of electrical control panel box

     
** GROUP B (ELECTRICAL & ELECTRONICS ENGINEERING PRACTICE)

   with single phase AC two wire system -- Designing assembling
   andtesting of single phase 3 wire connection for a room with fan,
   tube light, and 3-point socket with control switches.
2. Energy measurement with RLC Load.Design and find the power and
   energy consumption of a residential house when all appliances are
   in use for 10 hours per day for 60 days.
3. Earth resistance measurement. Fault diagnosis analysis of in
   electrical appliances.
4. Measurement of AC parameters using CRO and half wave and Full wave
   rectifier. Design assemble and test a charger for cell phone.
5. Study of logic gates AND, OR, EX-OR & NOT. Design assemble and test
   a basic controller with relay for a washing machine and a half
   adder using Logic gates.
6. Soldering practice -- Components Devices and Circuits -- Using
   PCB. Design assemble and test a dc power supply using PCB
