** R2018 CHANGES                                                   :noexport:
 1. 2 Experiments removed
 2. Shell programming experiment removed.
 3. Deadlock detection is removed as deadlock avoidance is already there under deadlock concept. 
 4. Five course outcomes clearly defined and aligned with the experiments
 5. Lab requirements clearly outlined.


** COURSE OBJECTIVES
- To learn and implement basic Unix commands using system calls
- To implement various CPU Scheduling Algorithms
- To implement Process Creation and Inter Process Communication
- To implement Deadlock Avoidance and Deadlock Detection algorithms
- To implement Page Replacement Algorithms
- To implement File Organization and File Allocation Strategies

** SUGGESTIVE EXPERIMENTS
1. Basics of UNIX commands and study of system calls.
2. Implement a few UNIX commands using system calls.
3. Implement Shared memory and IPC
4. Implement the various CPU Scheduling Algorithms
5. Implement Semaphores
6. Implement Bankers Algorithm for Deadlock Avoidance
7. Develop applications using threads
8. Implement the following Memory Allocation Methods for variable
   sized partition: a) First Fit b) Worst Fit c) Best Fit
