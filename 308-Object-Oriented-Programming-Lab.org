** COURSE OBJECTIVES
- To build software development skills using object oriented
  programming for real world applications
- To develop applications using inheritance and polymorphism
- To understand and implement generic programming.

** SUGGESTIVE EXPERIMENTS
1.	Program using classes and objects (Eg: Electricity bill generation)
2.	Program using Inheritance (Eg: Payrollapplication)
3.	Program to implement Polymorphism (E.g. Area of different shapes)
4.	Design a Java interface for ADTs. (E.g. Stack, Queue)
5.	Programs using Exception handling. (E.g. Bank Account manipulation)
6.	Program to implement packages (Eg: Currency converter)
7.	Program to implement generic classes, methods (Eg: Generic stack, Sorting)
8.	Program to perform operations using Collection classes (Eg: ArrayList, LinkedList)
9.	Develop a mini project for any application using the constructs of Java.
