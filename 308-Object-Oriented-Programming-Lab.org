** COURSE OBJECTIVES
- To build software development skills using object oriented
  programming for real world applications
- To develop applications using inheritance and polymorphism
- To understand and implement generic programming.

** SUGGESTIVE EXPERIMENTS
1.	Build an application using classes and objects (Eg: Electricity bill generation)
2.	Develop an application using Inheritance (Eg: Payrollapplication)
3.	Write a program to experiment with Polymorphism (E.g. Area of different shapes)
4.	Design a Java interface for ADTs. (E.g. Stack, Queue)
5.	Programs using Exception handling. (E.g. Bank Account manipulation)
6.	Program to implement packages (Eg: Currency converter)
7.	Program to implement generic classes, methods (Eg: Generic stack, Sorting)
8.	Program to perform operations using Collection classes (Eg: ArrayList, LinkedList)
9.	Develop a mini project for any application using the constructs of Java.

** COURSE OUTCOMES
After the completion of this course, students will be able to: 
- Develop applications in Java using classes and methods(K3)
- Apply inheritance and interface concepts to write programs(K4)
- Build Java programs using polymorphic methods and objects(K4)
- Develop applications using generic methods and generic programming(K3)
- Solve real-world problem in team by applying the appropriate features of object-oriented programming paradigm with best practices and document its methodology (K4).
