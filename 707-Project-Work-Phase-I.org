** COURSE OBJECTIVES
- To develop skills to formulate a complex engineering problem with an awareness of  issues pertaining to  society, health, safety, legal, environment, culture   and examine the impact of the proposed solution on these  issues.
- To carry out the survey on related literature and find out the research gap
-	To explore use of new tools, algorithms and techniques required to carry out the projects.
-	To enable the students to gain experience in organization and implementation of a project and acquire the necessary confidence to carry out the extensions of the project in the phase 2.
-	To follow the guidelines and prepare technical report of the project.
-	To develop team management skills and presentation skills

  
** COURSE OUTCOMES
At the end of this course, the students will be able to:

- Formulate complex engineering problems and choose suitable technologies and tools   
           required to solve them effectively (K4)
- Analyse the related literature on the proposed problem and its feasibility (K4)
- Construct  suitable solutions by applying software engineering principles (K6)
- Divide the work appropriately among the team members to manage time and   
          complexity  (K4)
- Evaluate, document and present the solution (K5)
- Analyse the issues pertaining to society, health, safety, legal, environment, culture   
          applicable to the project and examine the impact of the proposed solution on these   
           issues. (K4)
- Apply best practices and follow ethics in developing the solutions (K3)
