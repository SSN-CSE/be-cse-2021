** COURSE OBJECTIVES
- To develop skills to formulate a complex engineering problem
- To carry out the survey on related literature and find out the
  research gap
- To explore use of new tools, algorithms and techniques required to
  carry out the projects
- To enable the students to gain experience in organization and
  implementation of a small project and thus acquire the necessary
  confidence to carry out project in the phase 2
- To provide guidelines to prepare technical report of the project.
  
** COURSE OUTCOMES
After the completion of this course, students will be able to 
1. Formulate complex engineering problems and choose suitable
   technologies and tools required to solve them effectively
   (K4)
2. Analyse the related literature on the proposed problem and its
   feasibility (K4)
3. Construct suitable solutions by applying software engineering
   principles (K6)
4. Evaluate, document, and present the solution (K5)
5. Apply best practices and follow ethics in developing the solutions
   (K3)
