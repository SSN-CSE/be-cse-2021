** R2021 CHANGES :noexport:
1. The knowlede level of unit1 was modified from K2 to K3
2. Unit1 was reordered
3. Reference book was added  for the unit1

** COURSE OBJECTIVES
   - To learn algorithmic problem solving techniques.
   - To learn the fundamentals of python programming.
   - To compose programs in Python using conditions, iterations and decompose a problem into functions
   - To construct programs in Python sequenced data type.
   - To develop python programs using advanced constructs like dictionaries and files. 

{{{unit}}}
| UNIT I | ALGORITHMIC PROBLEM SOLVING  | 9 |
Logical and Algorithmic Thinking: Logical Thinking -- Algorithmic
Thinking; Problem Solving and Decomposition: Defining the Problem --
Devising the Solution -- Decomposition; Effective building blocks:
Basic Algorithmic Constructs (pseudo code, flow chart, programming
language) -- Program State.

{{{unit}}}
| UNIT II | DATA, EXPRESSION, STATEMENT, CONDITIONAL | 9 |
Data and types: int, float, boolean, string, list; variables,
expressions, statements, simultaneous assignment, precedence of
operators; comments; in-built modules and functions; Conditional:
boolean values and operators, conditional (if), alternative (if-else),
case analysis (if-elif-else).

{{{unit}}}
| UNIT III | ITERATION, FUNCTION, STRINGS | 9 |
Iteration: while, for, break, continue, pass; Functions: function
definition, function call, flow of execution, parameters and
arguments, return values, local and global scope, recursion; Strings:
string slices, immutability, string functions and methods, string
module.

{{{unit}}}
| UNIT IV | LISTS, TUPLES | 9 |
Lists: list operations, list slices, list methods, list loop,
mutability, aliasing, cloning lists, list parameters, nested lists,
list comprehension; Tuples: tuple assignment, tuple as return value,
tuple operations.

{{{unit}}}
| UNIT V | DICTIONARIES, FILES | 9 |
Dictionaries: operations and methods, looping and dictionaries,
reverse lookup, dictionaries and lists; Files: Text files, reading and
writing files, format operator, file names and paths; command line
arguments.

** COURSE OUTCOMES
After the completion of this course, students will be able to:
- Solve programming problems and express solutions in pseudo code (K3).
- Develop simple programs using basic constructs (K3).
- Construct programs using conditions and iterations decompose a problem into functions. (K3)
- Make use of strings, lists, tuples and  dictionaries data structures (K3).
- Develop Input/Output Operations using files (K3).
