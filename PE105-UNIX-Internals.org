** COURSE OBJECTIVES
- To understand the Unix kernel and the various subsystems.
- To understand file organization and management.
- To learn about implementation of various system calls.
- To have a thorough understanding of process architecture, process
  control, scheduling and interprocess communication
- To understand the different memory management policies.

** COURSE OUTCOMES
After the completion of this course, students will be able to 
1. Demonstrate the different scenarios of buffer usage and Inode
   manipulation (K2)
2. Interpret the working of file subsystem and its system calls.(K2)
3. Illustrate the various aspects of Process Control and management
   (K2)
4. Interpret the memory management and I/O policies (K2)
5. Apply various process scheduling algorithms and IPC techniques
   (K3).
