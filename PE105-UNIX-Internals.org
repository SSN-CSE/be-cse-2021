** COURSE OBJECTIVES
- To understand the Unix kernel and the various subsystems.
- To understand file organization and management.
- To learn about implementation of various system calls.
- To have a thorough understanding of process architecture, process
  control, scheduling and interprocess communication
- To understand the different memory management policies.

System Memory -- Context of a Process -- Saving the Context --
Manipulation of a Process Address Space -- Sleep. Process Control:
Process creation -- Signals -- Process Termination -- System Boot and
the INIT Process.
