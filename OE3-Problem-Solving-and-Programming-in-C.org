|      | PROBLEM SOLVING AND PROGRAMMING IN C | 2 | 0 | 2 | 3 |


** COURSE OBJECTIVES
- To use basic programming concepts of C
- To develop programs using loops, functions, arrays, pointers,
  strings, structures and files.

{{{unit}}}
| UNIT I | BASICS | 6 |
Algorithm -- Structure of a C program -- Data Types: built-in, user-defined -- Variables and constants -- Input and output statements -- Operators, expressions, and assignment statements -- Control statements.


{{{unit}}}
| UNIT II | FUNCTIONS | 6 |
Function prototype -- Function definition and call -- Passing parameters -- Built-in functions -- Recursion; Command line arguments.

{{{unit}}}
| UNIT III | ARRAYS AND STRINGS | 6 |
Arrays: Declaration, initialization -- One-dimensional arrays -- Multi-dimensional arrays; Strings: Constants and variables, reading and writing strings, string operations, string library. 

{{{unit}}}
| UNIT IV | POINTERS, STRUCTURES AND UNIONS | 6 |
Pointers: Pointer operations -- Array of pointers -- Passing arrays to functions; Structures: Structures and functions -- Array of structures -- Pointer to a structure â€“ unions. 

{{{unit}}}
| UNIT V | FILES | 6 |
Files: opening and closing a data file -- Creating a data file -- Processing a data file -- Unformatted data files -- Formatted input and output -- Line input and output -- File error handling.

\hfill *Theory Periods: 30*

** SUGGESTIVE EXPERIMENTS
 - Program using I/O statements, conditional constructs (if, switch,
   ternary) and looping constructs (for, while, do-while)
 - Program functions with different parameter passing techniques: Call
   by value, call by reference (e.g. changing the elements of an
   array)
 - Programs using one dimensional arrays (e.g. Insertion sort)
 - Program using strings and their operations (e.g. concatenation of
   strings, extracting a substring, checking for palindrome)
 - Program to demonstrate simple structure manipulations
   (e.g. generating a transcript with CGPA and class obtained)
 - Programs to demonstrate file operations (e.g. count the number of
   characters, words and lines in a file).

\hfill *Practical Periods: 30*

\hfill *Total Periods: 60*

** COURSE OUTCOMES
After the completion of this course, students will be able to: 
- Develop programs using basic programming constructs in C (K3) 
- Develop modular programs using functions (K3) 
- Develop applications using arrays and strings (K3)
- Solve problems using pointers and structures (K3) 
- Develop applications using file operations in C (K3).
