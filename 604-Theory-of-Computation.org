** COURSE OBJECTIVES
- To learn the mathematical notations and construct finite automata of the given language
- To understand and infer the relationship of finite automate and regular expressions
- To understand the language hierarchy, relationship between context free grammar and its language and to construct a PDA of CFG.
- To understand Turing machines and their programming capability
- To infer the knowledge of undecidable problems.

#+begin_comment
1. From the previous syllabus Unit 1 is splitted into two units.
2. This subject is not offered under M.E syllabus.
3. One more CO is inculded and CO's are modified to align with units.
